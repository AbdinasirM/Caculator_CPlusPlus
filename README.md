## Introduction
The calculator project consists of a C++ program that utilizes the `mycalc` class defined in the `calculator.h` header file. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and performs various arithmetic operations on them using the `mycalc` class methods.

## Installation
To use this calculator project, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
3. Compile the source code files:
   ```
   g++ mainCalculator.cpp calculator.cpp
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./calculator
   ```

## Usage
Once you have installed the calculator project, follow these steps to use it:

1. Run the `calculator` executable.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. The program will calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.
5. The results will be displayed on the console.

## Running Online
If you don't have a C++ compiler installed locally, you can also run the code online using platforms such as [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/). Follow the steps below:

1. Visit [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) or a similar online C++ compiler platform.
2. Create a new C++ project or open an existing one.
3. Copy and paste the code from the repository's `main.cpp` and `calculator.h` files into the respective files in the online compiler.
4. Select C++ as the language for compilation.
5. Click the "Run" or "Compile" button to execute the code.
6. Enter the first and second numbers when prompted.
7. The program will calculate the arithmetic operations and display the results in the online compiler's output window.
